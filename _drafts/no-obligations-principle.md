It is a very common problem in project management &mdash; how to
make team members more responsible and avoid micro management.
We create plans, draw Gantt charts, announce milestones,
motivate everybody and promise big bonuses on success.

## Excuses

Then everybody starts working and we're starting to hear excuses:

 * "The class is not yet ready, I was doing something else"
 * "May I take a day off tomorrow because of my birthday?"
 * "May I skip the unit test because I don't know how to fix it?"
 * "I don't know why this doesn't work, maybe someone can help me?"
 * "I tried, but this doesn't work, what can I do?"

By that excuses team members are transferring responsibility
back to the project manager. There was a very famous article
published by Oxford Management a few years ago, about "Management Monkeys"...

A traditional way to transfer responsibility back to team members
is to become an asshole. You have a birthday tomorrow? I don't care,
you still have to meet your deadline. You don't know how to fix the
unit test? Not my problem, it should be fixed by tomorrow. Etc.

I find this extremely annoying and destructive for the project. Project
environment becomes very unhealthy and good people leave.

However, in order to keep the project in its borders and meet
all the milestones, responsibility should be on the shoulders of
team members. They should be responsible for their own tasks and
report back to the project manager when they are done.

Implementation problems should be solved by team members on their own.

## I owe you nothing

In XDSD there is the first fundamental principle that says
the everybody should be paid for deliverables. Based on this
idea we can go even further and declare a "No Obligations" principle.

In essence, for every team member, it says: if you don’t like the task assigned
to you, or you don’t have time, or you’re simply not in the mood &mdash; don't do it.
You have no obligations to do anything. You're free to reject every second
task that a project manager gives to you, of all of them.

On the other hand, a project manager is not obliged to keep a task assigned
to you for longer than 10 days (we think that this time frame is logical).
If you get a task and don't deliver in ten days, the project manager
can take it away from you, paying nothing. No matter how much time you
invested into it already, and why you failed.

## Where are the monkeys?

This principles helps us to separate responsibilities between a project
manager and team members. The manager is responsible for finding the right
people and giving them the right tasks. It is his management problem, if
he will be getting too many rejections from the team.

On the other hand, his team members are responsible for their tasks
and can't give any excuses any more. Well, they can, but they won't
change anything. No matter what their excuses are, the deliverables
will be purchased only from the person who manages to complete the task
in time.
