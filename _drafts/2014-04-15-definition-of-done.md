[Definition of Done (DoD)](https://www.scrum.org/Resources/Scrum-Glossary/Definition-of-Done)
is one of key definitions in Scrum, which we're also using in XDSD.
DoD is an exit criteria of a simple atomic task. DoD answers the
question "am I done with this task?"

Moreover, it answers the question "will I be paid for the task?"

In XDSD, the definition of done is very simple &mdash; the task is done if
and only if its author accepts the deliverables.

On the other hand, the first and the most important principle of XDSD
states that everybody is paid only for deliverables. Combining together
the definition of done and the principle of paying only for deliverable
results gives us a very important conclusion: un-finished tasks
are not paid.

Every task has its own budget, and no matter how many people tried
to work with the task, only the last one, who managed to deliver
the result, will be paid. Read also about

You goal, as a developer working on a task, is to close it
and get paid, as soon as possible. There are a few hints that will help you
to achieve this without frustration:

 * don't even start a task if you're not sure you can finish it
 * ask the author of the task all questions up-front
 * don't assume anything &mdash; ask if you're not sure
 * chase task author and ask to close the task &mdash; be aggressive
 * don't expect any help from anyone &mdash; you're on your own
 * ask about payment if it didn't happen automatically

It is important to remember, that it is your responsibility, as a developer,
to close the task and make sure it was paid.
