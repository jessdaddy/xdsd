In XDSD, everybody, including project managers, analysts, programmers,
and product owners, get paid by deliverables with agreed upon budgets.
The first section of
[How XDSD Is Different]({% post_url 2014/2014-04-17-how-xdsd-is-different %})
article explains how exactly this works. However, it doesn't
explain how do we decide which hourly rate is
acceptable for each project participant.

When new people come to us, usually they have some numbers in mind. They
know how much they expect to make per week, per month, of per day.
We rarely negotiate the rate. We just accept the offer. However, every
few months we review the rate and change it (increasing or decreasing).

Below is a list of factors that influence our decision making process.
It is important to mention that, unlike most other companies
and software teams, we don't pay attention to the following factors:

 * your geographic location
 * skills and experience in the CV
 * amount of time spent on the project already
 * age, sex, nationality, religious beliefs, etc.

However, the factors listed below, are very important for us. They
significantly affect your "overall score" and will decrease or increase
the rate. We don't negotiate when we change the rate.

Keep in mind that besides decreasing your hourly rate a low
overall score affects the amount of tasks you will be getting from us.
The best developers get the most of the new tasks.

So, read on, follow our principles, and enjoy higher rates :)

## Fast Delivery

The faster you deliver, the better. We track
all tasks completed by you and can easily calculate how many days
it takes to close an average task. To increase this metric you should
try to close tasks sooner or get rid of them faster.

If you see
that the task is not suitable for you, don't hold it. Instead, inform
your project manager that you are not going to work on the task and
he will try to find you something else.

By the way, the best developers close their tasks in five calendar days,
on average.

## Past Due Tasks

Even though we encourage everybody to reject tasks that they
don't like, we are strongly against overdue tasks. Once you started
to work with a task, we expect you to finish it in time.

Our [No Obligation Principle]({% post_url 2014/2014-04-13-no-obligations-principle %})
gives our project managers freedom to take any task away from
you if you're working with it for too long.

Once this happens, your overall score is negatively affected.

Even very good developers have some overdue tasks, this is life. However,
they keep their number to the minimum, around one overdue task per twenty
successfully completed in time.

## Complexity

Every task has a project role assigned to it.
[Puzzle Driven Development by Roles]({% post_url 2014/2014-04-12-puzzle-driven-development-by-roles %})
lists key roles we have in XDSD projects. The higher the
role, the higher the complexity of the task.

Closing a task in "architect" role is much more important
than closing a task in "implementer" (or "developer") role.

The more tasks you close on your current role, the faster you
will be shifted up and your rate will be increased. Very often
our developers sit on a few roles at the same time.

## Lengthy Discussions

We discourage long conversations in one task.
The longer the discussion, the lower your quality as a developer. Ideal
developer should get a task, deliver the result and inform the task
author that it's done. Then, the task is closed and paid.

We automatically
track the number of messages you post and receive in your tasks, and they
negatively affect your overall score.

In order to avoid long conversations
you should submit new tickets with questions or bug reports.
[Puzzle Driven Development by Roles]({% post_url 2014/2014-04-12-puzzle-driven-development-by-roles %})
article explains the whole idea of helping us "to break the project"
by submitting new bugs into it. Follow this concept and you'll be fine.

## Contribution via Bugs

In XDSD
[Bugs Are Welcome]({% post_url 2014/2014-04-13-bugs-are-welcome %}). You
are supposed to report bugs along the normal development activities.
Besides getting extra money for them you increase your overall rating.

The best developers submit one bug for every 2-3 tasks.
