## What's XDSD

XDSD is an open software development methodology aimed to reduce risks
and improve quality in a software project of almost any size. At the moment,
there are four fundamental principles:

<ul class="principles">
    <li>Everyone gets paid for verified deliverables</li>
    <li>Defects are planned and don't block delivery</li>
    <li>Quality-of-code metrics are CI gate conditions</li>
    <li>VCS commits to master branch are prohibited</li>
</ul>

XDSD effectively wraps other software development methodologies
(incl. Agile/XP, RUP&reg;, MSF&reg;, and even Waterfall) to maximize
quality of the delivered product and increase team productivity.
