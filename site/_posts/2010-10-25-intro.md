XDSD is an open software development methodology aimed to reduce risks
and improve quality in a software project of almost any size.

At the moment, there are four fundamental principles:

 * Everyone gets paid for verified deliverables
 * Defects are planned and don't block delivery
 * Quality-of-code metrics are CI gate conditions
 * VCS commits to master branch are prohibited

XDSD effectively wraps other software development methodologies
(incl. Agile/XP, RUP&reg;, MSF&reg;, and even Waterfall) to maximize
quality of the delivered product and increase team productivity.
