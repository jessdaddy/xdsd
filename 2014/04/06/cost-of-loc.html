  <p>Yes, I know, line of code is a very wrong metric. There were tons of
articles written about it, including famous books. However, I want to
compare two projects I&#39;ve recently taken participation in.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Traditionally co-located</h2>

<p>The first one was done by a traditionally co-located group of programmers.
There were about 25 of them (I&#39;m not counting managers, analysts,
product owners, SCRUM masters, etc.) The project is a web auctioning site, with
pretty high traffic (over two million page views per day).</p>

<p>The code base size was about 200k lines, where 150k was PHP, 35k in JavaScript and the
rest in CSS, XML, Ruby, and something else. I&#39;m counting only non-empty and
non-comment lines of code, using
<a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/"><code>cloc.pl</code></a>.</p>

<p>It was commercial projects, so I can&#39;t disclose their names.</p>

<p>The team was co-located in one office in Europe, where everybody were
working from nine till five. We had meetings, lunches, desk-to-desk chats,
and all that stuff. All tasks were tracked in JIRA.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Extremely distributed</h2>

<p>The second one was an open source Java product, developed by an
<a href="http://www.xdsd.org">extremely distributed</a>
team of about 15 developers. We didn&#39;t have any chats, or
any other informal communications. We discussed everything in
tickets, using Github issue tracking. Code base was significantly smaller
with about 30k lines, where 90% was in Java and the rest in XML.</p>

<p>Both projects hosted their code bases in Github.</p>

<p>Both teams were using build automation, continuous integration, pre-flight
builds, static analysis, and code reviews. Both projects satisfied
the requirements of their users. I&#39;m mentioning this in order to show
that both projects produced valueable and useful lines of code. There was
no garbage and almost no code duplication.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Show me the money</h2>

<p>In both projects my role was called a lead architect, and I know their
economics. Besides that, I had access to both Git repositories, so I
can measure how many new lines (or changed lines) were introduced by both
teams in, say, three months period.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s see the numbers.</p>

<p>The first project (the co-located one) was paying approximately &euro;50,000
annual salary to a good developer, which was about $5,600 per month
or about $35 per hour. The second one (an extremely distributed)
was paying $30-40 per hour.</p>

<p>The first one, in three months produced 59k new lines and removed
29k changes in <code>master</code> branch, which in total equals to 88k. The
project spent about 10,000 hours to produce these lines
(20 programmers, 3 months, 170 working hours per month) or $350k. This means that
the project paid <strong>$3.98 per LoC</strong>.</p>

<p>The second one, in three months produced 45k new lines and removed 9k, which
in total equals to 54k. To complete this work we&#39;ve spent $7k
(approximately 200 working hours).
That means that the project paid <strong>$0.13 per LoC</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">So, what?</h2>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say by these numbers is that distributed
programming is much more effective, money-wise, than co-located teams.
Again, I can hear you saying that a line of code is not a proper metric.
But, come on, $0.13 vs. $3.98? Thirty times more expensive? It&#39;s not about
metrics any more. It&#39;s about waste of money. Big time.</p>

<p>Of course, this result can&#39;t be achieved just by telling your programmers
to work from home and never come to the office. XDSD is not about that.
<a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> is about strict quality principles, which should
be followed by the entire team.</p>

<p>And when these principles are in place &mdash; you pay thirty time less for
the same result.</p>
