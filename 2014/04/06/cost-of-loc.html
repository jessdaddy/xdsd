  <p>Yes, I know, &quot;line of code&quot; (LoC)
is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/966800/mythical-man-month-10-lines-per-developer-day-how-close-on-large-projects">very wrong metric</a>.
There were <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/diseconomies-of-scale-and-lines-of-code/">tons of articles</a>
written about it, including famous books.</p>

<p>However, I want to compare two projects I&#39;ve recently taken participation in,
and show some very interesting numbers.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Project #1: traditionally co-located</h2>

<p>The first software project I was part of,
was done by a traditionally co-located group of programmers.
There were about 20 of them (I&#39;m not counting managers, analysts,
product owners, SCRUM masters, etc.) The project is a web auctioning site, with
pretty high traffic (over two million page views per day).</p>

<p><img src="http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/brazil-crowded-office.jpg"
  style="width: 600px;"
  alt="Brazil (1985) by Terry Gilliam"/></p>

<p>The code base size was about 200k lines, where 150k was PHP, 35k in JavaScript and the
rest in CSS, XML, Ruby, and something else. I&#39;m counting only non-empty and
non-comment lines of code, using
<a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/"><code>cloc.pl</code></a>.</p>

<p>It was a commercial project, so I can&#39;t disclose its name.</p>

<p>The team was co-located in one office in Europe, where everybody were
working &quot;from nine till five&quot;. We had meetings, lunches, desk-to-desk chats,
and a lot of informal communications. All tasks were tracked in JIRA.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Project #2: extremely distributed</h2>

<p>The second project was an open source Java product, developed by an
<a href="http://www.xdsd.org">extremely distributed</a>
team of about 15 developers. We didn&#39;t have any chats, or
any other informal communications. We discussed everything in
tickets, using Github issue tracking. Code base was significantly smaller
with about 30k lines, where 90% was in Java and the rest in XML.</p>

<p><img src="http://img.xdsd.org/2014/04/shaolin-temple-jet-li.jpg"
  style="width: 600px;"
  alt="Shaolin Temple (1982) by Chang Hsin Yen"/></p>

<p>Both projects hosted their code bases in Github. Both teams
were developing in <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html">feature branches</a>,
even small fixes.</p>

<p>Both teams were using build automation, continuous integration, pre-flight
builds, static analysis, and code reviews. Both projects satisfied
the requirements of their users. I&#39;m mentioning this in order to emphasize
that both produces produced valueable and useful lines of code. There was
no garbage and almost no code duplication.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Show me the money</h2>

<p>In both projects my role was called a lead architect, and I know their
economics. Besides that, I had access to both Git repositories, so I
can measure how many new lines (or changed lines) were introduced by both
teams in, say, three months period.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s see the numbers.</p>

<p>The first project (the co-located one) was paying approximately &euro;50,000
annual salary to a good developer, which was about $5,600 per month
or about $35 per hour. The second one (an extremely distributed)
was paying $20-35 per hour, for completed tasks only, according to one of
the principles of <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>.</p>

<p>The first one, in three months produced 59k new lines and removed
29k changes in <code>master</code> branch, which in total equals to 88k. The
project spent about 10,000 hours to produce these lines
(20 programmers, 3 months, 170 working hours per month), which means $350k.
Thus, the project has paid <strong>$3.98 per LoC</strong>.</p>

<p>Taking into account other expenses a company has to pay in order to
maintain such a team, we can easily double this number and we&#39;ll get
very close to what people say about their projects
(that&#39;s all I&#39;ve found in public access, so far):</p>

<ul>
<li>$12&ndash;103: <a href="http://www.crazyontap.com/topic.php?TopicId=242135">crazyontap.com</a></li>
<li>$15&ndash;40: <a href="http://betterembsw.blogspot.nl/2010/10/embedded-software-costs-15-40-per-line.html">betterembsw.blogspot.nl</a></li>
<li>over $5: <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.467536.25">joelonsoftware.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The second project, in the same three months produced 45k new lines and removed 9k, which
in total equals to 54k. To complete this work we&#39;ve spent $7k
(approximately 350 working hours in 650 tasks).</p>

<p>Thus, the project has paid <strong>$0.13 per LoC</strong>. That also means
that programmers were writing approximately 270 lines per hour
or over 2,000 per day.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical Man-Month</a>
is talking about 10 lines per day, which is 200 times
less than we saw in our project.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re curios, I&#39;m using this script to get the numbers from git:</p>

<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><code class="bash">1
2</code></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>git log <span class="s2">&quot;--since=3 months&quot;</span> --pretty<span class="o">=</span>tformat: --numstat <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="p">|</span> gawk <span class="s1">&#39;{ add += $1; subs += $2; } END { printf &quot;added: %s removed: %s\n&quot;,add,subs,loc }&#39;</span> -
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>You can validate the numbers, the second project is in Github:
<a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github">jcabi/jcabi-github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">What does it all mean?</h2>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say by these numbers is that distributed
programming is much more effective, money-wise, than a co-located team.</p>

<p>Again, I can hear you saying that &quot;line of code&quot; is not a proper metric.
But, come on, $0.13 vs. $3.98? Thirty times more expensive? It&#39;s not about
numbers any more. It&#39;s about waste of money. Big time.</p>

<p>Of course, this result can&#39;t be achieved just by telling your programmers
to work from home and never come to the office. XDSD is not about that.
<a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> is about strict quality principles, which should
be followed by the entire team.</p>

<p>And when these principles are in place &mdash; you pay thirty times less.</p>
