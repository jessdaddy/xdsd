  <p>Yes, I know, &quot;line of code&quot; (LoC)
is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/966800/mythical-man-month-10-lines-per-developer-day-how-close-on-large-projects">very wrong metric</a>.
There are <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/diseconomies-of-scale-and-lines-of-code/">tons of articles</a>
written about it, as well as famous books.</p>

<p>However, I want to compare two projects in which I have participated recently
and discuss some very interesting numbers.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Project #1: Traditionally Co-located</h2>

<p>The first project I was apart of was performed  by a traditionally co-located
group of programmers. There were about 20 of them (I&#39;m not counting managers,
analysts,product owners, SCRUM masters, etc.) The project was a web auctioning
site with pretty high traffic numbers (over two million page views per day).</p>

<p>The code base size was about 200k lines, of which 150k was PHP, 35k JavaScript
and the remainder CSS, XML, Ruby, and something else. I&#39;m counting only
non-empty and non-comment lines of code, using
<a href="http://cloc.sourceforge.net/"><code>cloc.pl</code></a>.</p>

<p>It was a commercial project, so I can&#39;t disclose its name.</p>

<p>The team was co-located in one office in Europe where everybody was working
&quot;from nine &#39;til five&quot;. We had meetings, lunches, desk-to-desk chats and lots of
other informal communications. All tasks were tracked in JIRA.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Project #2: Extremely Distributed</h2>

<p>The second project was an open source Java product, developed by an <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">extremely
distributed</a> team of about 15 developers. We didn&#39;t have
any chats or any other informal communications. We discussed everything in
Github issues. The code base was significantly smaller with only about 30k
lines, of which about 90% was Java and the rest in XML.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Maturity of Development</h2>

<p>Both projects hosted their code bases on Github. Both teams were developing in
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html">feature branches</a>- even for
small fixes.</p>

<p>Both teams used build automation, continuous integration, pre-flight builds,
static analysis and code reviews. This indicates the maturity of the project
teams.</p>

<p>Both projects satisfied the requirements of their users. I&#39;m mentioning this to
emphasize that both projects produced valuable and useful lines of code. There
was no garbage and almost no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_code">code
duplication</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Show Me the Money</h2>

<p>In both projects, my role was called that of lead architect, and I know their
economics and financials. Besides that, I had access to both Git repositories,
so I can measure how many new lines (or changed lines) were introduced by both
teams in, say, a three-month period.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s see the numbers.</p>

<p>The first project (the one that was co-located) was paying approximately
&euro;50,000 annually to a good developer, which was about $5,600 per month or
$35 per hour. The second one (the extremely distributed project) was paying
$20-35 per hour, for completed tasks only according to one of the principles of
<a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>.</p>

<p>The first one, in three months, produced 59k new lines and removed 29k in
changes in the <code>master</code> branch, which in totals 88k lines of code. The project
resulted in about 10,000 man hours to produce these lines (20 programmers, three
months, 170 working hours per month) &mdash; which equates to about $350k. Therefore,
the project cost a whopping</p>

<p style="color:red;text-align:center;font-size:2em;">$3.98 per line</p>

<p>The second project, in the same three month period, produced 45k new lines and
removed 9k, which comes to 54k in all. To complete this work, we spent only $7k
(approximately 350 working hours in 650 tasks). Thus, the project costs merely:</p>

<p style="color:green;text-align:center;font-size:2em;">&cent;13 per line</p>

<p>This also means that programmers were writing approximately 270 lines per hour
or over 2,000 per day. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical
Man-Month</a> talks about 10
lines per day, which is 200 times less than we saw in our project.</p>

<p>$350k vs $7k, $3.98 vs &cent;13? What do you think?</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">How to Validate the Numbers?</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re curios, I&#39;m using this script to get the numbers from Git:</p>

<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><code class="bash">1
2</code></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>git log <span class="s2">&quot;--since=3 months&quot;</span> --pretty<span class="o">=</span>tformat: --numstat <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="p">|</span> gawk <span class="s1">&#39;{ add += $1; subs += $2; } END { printf &quot;added: %s removed: %s\n&quot;,add,subs,loc }&#39;</span> -
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>You can validate the numbers for the second project here on Github:
<a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github">jcabi/jcabi-github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Conclusion</h2>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to express with these numbers is that distributed programming is
much more effective, money-wise, than a co-located team. Again, I can hear you
saying that &quot;line of code&quot; is not a proper metric. But, come on, $0.13 vs.
$3.98? Thirty times more expensive?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about metrics any more. It&#39;s about preventing wasteful man hours and
the huge waste of money that comes with them?</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Can We Do the Same?</h2>

<p>Of course, the same results can&#39;t be achieved by just telling your programmers
to work from home and never come to the office. XDSD is not about that.
<a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> is about strict quality principles, which should be
followed by the entire team.</p>

<p>And when these principles are in place &mdash; you pay thirty times less.</p>

<p>By the way, this is what people say about their projects:</p>

<li>over $5: <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz.5.467536.25">joelonsoftware.com</a></li>
